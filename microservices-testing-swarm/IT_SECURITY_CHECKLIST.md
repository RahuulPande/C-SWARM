# IT & Security Review Checklist

Adaptive Microservices Testing Swarm

---

## 1. Deployment & Network
- [ ] All components (backend, frontend, agents, mock/real services) run on client-controlled infrastructure (on-prem, VM, or private cloud)
- [ ] No external API calls or cloud dependencies in default configuration
- [ ] All network ports (8001, 3000, 5001-5012) are documented and configurable
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict access to only authorized users/networks

## 2. Data Privacy & Compliance
- [ ] No sensitive data leaves the client network
- [ ] All logs, test data, and results are stored locally
- [ ] No telemetry, analytics, or external logging is enabled by default
- [ ] Data retention and deletion policies are documented

## 3. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] (For production) Add authentication to backend APIs (e.g., OAuth2, SSO, or bank-standard auth)
- [ ] (For production) Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for UI and API endpoints
- [ ] (For demo) Default config allows open access for ease of use; review before production

## 4. Code & Dependency Review
- [ ] All source code is open and auditable by client IT/security
- [ ] Dependencies are open source and listed in requirements.txt/package.json
- [ ] No known critical vulnerabilities in dependencies (run `pip-audit`/`npm audit`)
- [ ] Remove or restrict any demo/test data before production use

## 5. Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Logging is local and can be integrated with client SIEM/log management
- [ ] (For production) Add monitoring/alerting for backend and microservices
- [ ] Review log levels to avoid leaking sensitive data

## 6. Customization & Integration
- [ ] Mock services can be replaced with real microservices as needed
- [ ] Service discovery agent can be pointed at real endpoints
- [ ] Agents can be extended with client-specific logic or AI models

## 7. Change Management
- [ ] All changes are tracked in version control (Git)
- [ ] Deployment and rollback procedures are documented

## 8. User Training & Documentation
- [ ] Users are provided with up-to-date README, FAQ, and technical overview
- [ ] Demo script and troubleshooting guide are available
