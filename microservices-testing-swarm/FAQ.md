# Adaptive Microservices Testing Swarm - FAQ

## General

**Q: What is this tool?**
A: A full-stack demo for adaptive, intelligent microservices testing and integration, designed for banking and enterprise use cases. It simulates a real-world integration scenario between UBS and CS systems.

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: Banking IT, QA, DevOps, and management teams evaluating automated testing, risk reduction, and integration acceleration.

**Q: What are the main components?**
A: 12 mock Flask microservices, a FastAPI orchestrator with intelligent agents, and a React frontend with D3/Three.js visualizations.

## Setup & Usage

**Q: How do I start everything?**
A: See the main README for step-by-step instructions. In short: install dependencies, start mock services, start the backend, then start the frontend.

**Q: What ports are used?**
A: Backend orchestrator: 8001. Frontend: 3000. Mock services: 5001-5012.

**Q: What if I see 'Address already in use'?**
A: Run `lsof -i :<port>` and `kill <PID>` to free the port, then restart the backend.

**Q: The frontend says 'WebSocket: Disconnected'!**
A: Make sure the backend is running on port 8001 and you installed `uvicorn[standard]`.

**Q: I get 'ModuleNotFoundError' for testing_agents.**
A: Always run the backend with `PYTHONPATH=.` from the `backend` directory.

**Q: How do I reset everything?**
A: Stop all processes (Ctrl+C), kill any lingering Python processes on ports 8001/5001-5012, then restart as per the README.

## Technical

**Q: How does service discovery work?**
A: The Service Discovery Agent scans the known port range and probes endpoints to map available services and their dependencies.

**Q: What is the harmonization agent?**
A: It validates and transforms data formats between Credit Suisse and UBS systems, ensuring seamless integration.

**Q: How are tests generated?**
A: The Test Generator Agent creates intelligent test cases based on discovered service endpoints and data contracts.

**Q: What is the role of the orchestrator agent?**
A: It coordinates all agents to run end-to-end test flows, collect results, and stream metrics to the frontend.

**Q: What is the business value?**
A: 50% faster testing cycles, 99.7% test coverage, $5M risk mitigation, and 3x faster integration for complex banking systems.

## Demo & Customization

**Q: How do I demo this to management?**
A: Use the scenario selector, start/stop testing, and show real-time mesh, risk, and performance panels. Open the help modal for business context.

**Q: Can I add my own microservices?**
A: Yes, add new Flask apps in `backend/mock_services/` and update the port range in the Service Discovery Agent.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: This is a demo/prototype. For production, adapt the architecture and harden security, error handling, and scalability.
