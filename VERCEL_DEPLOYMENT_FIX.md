# 🚨 Vercel 404 Error - FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem:**
You encountered this error during Vercel deployment:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: fra1::bfncm-1755161249010-af6e9c6889a3
```

## ✅ **The Solution:**
I've fixed the Vercel configuration by:

1. **Created root-level `vercel.json`** with correct paths
2. **Removed duplicate config** from frontend directory
3. **Updated build commands** to navigate to frontend directory
4. **Committed and pushed** the fix to GitHub

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Before (Causing 404):**
- Vercel couldn't find the React app
- Build paths were incorrect
- Configuration was in wrong location

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- ✅ **Output Directory**: `frontend/build`
- ✅ **Install Command**: `cd frontend && npm install`
- ✅ **Source Path**: `frontend/package.json`

## 🚀 **Now Deploy Again:**

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
1. Visit [https://vercel.com/rahuul-pandes-projects](https://vercel.com/rahuul-pandes-projects)
2. Find your project or create new one

### **Step 2: Import Repository**
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Import: `RahuulPande/C-SWARM`
3. **Important**: Don't change any settings - use defaults
4. Click **"Deploy"**

### **Step 3: Success! 🎉**
Your app should now deploy successfully and you'll get a live URL like:
```
https://ubs-cs-integration-control-tower-[random].vercel.app
```

## 🔍 **Why This Happened:**
- Your React app is in `frontend/` directory
- Vercel was looking in the root directory
- The build paths weren't correctly configured
- Now Vercel knows exactly where to find and build your app

## 📱 **After Successful Deployment:**
1. Test all features work
2. Copy the live URL
3. Add to your resume
4. Share with recruiters!

**The fix is now deployed to GitHub. Try deploying to Vercel again - it should work perfectly!** 🚀✨
